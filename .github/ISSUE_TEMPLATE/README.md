# GitHub issue templates

## Template Chooser

A menu of issue categories will be presented when the user begins the issue creation process. This "template chooser" also contains links to relevant information, which can redirect support requests or other inappropriate/unproductive uses of the issue tracker.

If none of the issue types are applicable, the user can click the "Open a blank issue" link at the bottom of the issue template chooser page to get the previous issue creation behavior.

# GitHub issue form configuration files

GitHub's issue form system offers the option of presenting the contributor with a web form when creating an issue.

These forms can consist of several input field types including multi-line fields with the same formatting and attachment capabilities as the standard GitHub Issue composer, in addition to menus and checkboxes where appropriate.

The forms are configured via a YAML file.

The issue will be automatically labeled on creation according to the configuration of the template.
