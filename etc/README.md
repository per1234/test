## JSON Schemas

The [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) files are use by the generator to validate the format of the configuration data provided by the user.

They can also be utilized by users to directly validate their configuration files.

See:

- [**Generator Configuration JSON Schema** documentation](../README.md#generator-configuration-json-schema)
- [**Prompts Configuration JSON Schema** documentation](../README.md#prompts-configuration-json-schema)
